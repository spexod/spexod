**SpExod** is a Python library that allows users to connect to the SpExoDisks API aims to provide users with a
convenient and efficient way to access data from a particular source. It offers a set of functions and methods
that enable users to interact with the data programmatically, making it easier to retrieve and manipulate
the information as needed. One of the key advantages of using the Python API is its ability to access more data than
what is typically visible on the explore data page or user interface. While the explore data page may present a
limited subset of the available data, the Python API allows users to query and retrieve a broader range of information.
This can be particularly useful for users who require comprehensive access to the data for analysis, research, or other
purposes. Furthermore, the Python API allows users to access the data in its purest form, including any NULL or empty
values that may exist. This means that users have direct access to the original data structure and can work with it as
it is, without any modifications or preprocessing. This level of data integrity can be beneficial for advanced data
analysis or when specific processing steps need to be performed on the data.
